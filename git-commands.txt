Basic commands

(when we are cloning remote repo (github repo))
06. git clone - cloning a repo on our local machine
            git clone link_of_project
07. git status - it use to check status of project
            git status
                (if upto date then it will show 'nothing to commit')
                (if something to commit then it will show M (modified) in front of file and needs to commit and status will ask for add & commit and then if we create a file within a project then git status will show U (untracked) means git is not tracking that file)
                statuses of files : 
                    1. untracked - new file that git doesn't track yet (not commited file to git)
                    2. modified - something changed in tracked file
                    3. staged - added and ready to commit
                    4. unmodified - unchanged
08. git add - add and changed files in your working directory to the git staging area
            git add file_name OR everything to add use git add .
            (file with red font need to add)
09. git commit - it is the record of change in git
            git commit -m "some message"
            (file with green font need to commit)
10. git push - only after committing on local machine it doesn't make changes on github. So to make those changes happen we use git push
            git push origin main
                git push - we know
                origin - by default git repos are called as remote repos. and the repo we clone previously these changes to reflet there
                
(when we want to push our local folder to git)
if we want to make new folder or directly we can check if it is git repo by typing ls -a (if .git present then it will be a git repo otherwise we want to make it) 
so to make it git repo : 
11. git init - after using this command in folder our folder will become git repo (we can check it by using ls -a)
12. git add - to add files (git add file_name OR everything to add use git add .)
13. git commit - to commit files (git commit -m "some message")
    after committing, create a repo on github.com
14. git remote add origin link - it used to tell to github that we want to add new repo / remote
                                (origin - we can give other name instead of origin but if we give other name, then at the time of push we have to give that name, as we saw in 10th command)
                                (link - copy the link of the git repo)
15. git remote -v - it shows the remote we added (from 14) is now present with name. and the repo we got that will be pushed to git
16. git branch -  It shows on which branch we are on
        (we will see more about branch but just to get idea of branch - On project one team is working on frontend, second team is working on backend and third team is working on bug fix, then they make clone of repos of their concerned branch and work on it)
17. git branch -M main - as we know we are on master branch, but name master is not in used in git any more so to rename it we use this command
18. git push -u origin main - use to push our project on git 
                              -u = use when we want to work on this repo and dont want to use origin again again on same repo (we can even use 'git push origin main' , but at time of push we need to use 'origin main' always)
19. we can add readme.md then

(git branch)
20. git branch - to check the branch
21. git branch -M main - to rename the branch (we can put anything in lace of main)
22. git checkout branch_name - to go to another branch
23. git checkout -b new_branch_name - to create new branch
24. git branch -d branch_name - to delete branch (we can't delete branch in which we are currently working)
example - 
    to create branch - git branch => (main)
                       git checkout -b feature1 => (feature1 branch created)
                       git branch => (feature1)
                       git add . => to add branch in our git
                       git commit -m "message' => commit will happen
                       git push => to push feature1 on git
                       when we add any content while using branch feature1 in out file then it will be only for feature branch and if we git checkout main, this added things from feature 1 wont reflect for main branch, so to bring out those changes in main branch we have to make sure sure that we are on feature1 branch by using cmd git checkout feature1 then run,
                       git push origin feature1 => pushing changes to feature1 branch
                       go to github, it will show "compare and pull request" (it will merge feature1 with main), also we can see check branches there on which feature1 branch updates wont reflected in main branch. So to merge feature1 with main, there are 2 ways,
                       way 1 : 
                       git diff branch_name => it will compare 2 files, commits, branches (if we use this from feature1, it will show feature1 is ahead of main branch becasue we have added content from feature1 branch)
                       git merge main = it will merge feature 1 with main
                       way 2 :
                       create a PR - it is Pull Request, developers want to deploy their changes with project with main branch then this can be done in industires, if you make pull request, senior engineers will decide whether accept this pull request or not, and as they accept out feature1 branch will get reflected in main in git.
                       But in our code editor of local machine that feature1's code doesn't get reflected yet,becasue changes happened at git and not on local, so to bring that git changes on local use command, 
                       git pull origin main => it will bring changes of git on local
    to delete branch - git branch => (feature1)
     (from above)      git checkout -b feature2 => (feature2 branch created)
                       git branch => (feature2)
                       git checkout main or feature1 => main or feature1
                       git branch -d feature2 => it will delete the branch from project

(delete file from both local machine and git repo)
git rm file_name_with_extention - it will delete file from both local machine and git repo
git commit -m "Deleted example.txt" - then after deleting we have to commit the delete
git push - push this chnage to git

(delete file from only from git repo)
git rm --cached file_name_with_extention - it will delete file from git but not from local machine
git commit -m "Stop tracking secret.txt" - after deleting from there, commit the changes
git push - push the change to git

(put file .gitignore for a file that should not be tracked by git)
git rm --cached file_name_with_extention - it will delete file from git but not from local machine
echo file_name_with_extention >> .gitignore - it will add a file in .gitignore
git add .gitignore - staged/add .gitignore
git commit -m "added ignore.txt to .gitignore" - commit the changes
git push - to push in git
